# US International Alternate + Turkish Keyboard

This is a Windows keyboard layout based on the excellent 
"US International Alternate" layout, available on Ubuntu.
It uses "AltGr" -- combinations of the `right-ALT` key + letters to
produce non-English letters from most Western European languages.

I've added the three missing Turkish letters (ğ ş and ı).

You can use this one layout to type Turkish, German, Spanish, French, Italian... without 
messing up any keys already on your keyboard. Awesome!

### Key combinations for Turkish letters

On a US keyboard, `AltGr` is the **right ALT key** -- the ALT key to the right of the spacebar. 

* To produce the letter below, hold down the `RIGHT-ALT` key and press the letter.
* To produce a Capital Letter, hold down **both** `SHIFT` and `RIGHT-ALT` and then press the letter.
to produce the non-English letter below:




|Letter|How to Type It|
|------|--------------|
|  ç  | `RIGHT-ALT` + `,` |
|  ş  | `RIGHT-ALT` + `x` |
|  ğ  | `RIGHT-ALT` + `g` |
|  ı  | `RIGHT-ALT` + `h` |
|  İ  | `RIGHT-ALT` + `J` |
|  ö  | `RIGHT-ALT` + `p` |
|  ü  | `RIGHT-ALT` + `y` |
