# US International Alternate + Turkish Keyboard

This is a Windows keyboard layout based on the excellent 
"US International Alternate" layout, available on Ubuntu.
It uses combinations of AltGr (usually the right-CTRL key) to
produce non-English letters from Western European languages.

I've merely added the three missing Turkish letters (ğ ş and ı),
which means you can use this one layout to type
German, Turkish, Spanish, French, Italian and more -- without 
remapping any keys.

Instead of using "dead-keys" it maps non-English characters directly
onto combinations of AltGr (usually right-ALT, or ALT+CTRL).
